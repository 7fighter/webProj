Hi, I'm building a full-stack web app called **Requestly**, which is a real-time local marketplace. I've already built the frontend in React (without routing, using state/context for view control). The component structure includes:

- `LandingPage` shown when no user is logged in.
- `AuthModal` for login/register that sets the user in a global context (`AppContext`).
- Once logged in, the app shows `BuyerDashboard` or `SellerDashboard` based on user role.
- Features like Chat (`ChatSystem`), Notifications, and Profile are toggled via local `useState` in `App.tsx`.
- All data so far is mock (`mockData.ts`) and there’s no real API yet.

---

We just started working on the backend with the following stack:

**Backend Tech:**
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose
- JWT + bcrypt for authentication
- Socket.IO for real-time chat
- Axios on frontend for API calls

We’ve completed **Phase 1: Backend Setup**, which includes:
- Initializing the project (`npm init`)
- Installing dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`, `dotenv`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `cors`, `socket.io`)
- Folder structure:


- Created a basic `server.js` with express server and MongoDB connection
- `.env` file with `MONGO_URI`, `PORT`, and `JWT_SECRET`

Now we are about to begin **Phase 2: Auth System**, which includes:
- Creating a User model (name, email, password, role)
- Creating `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` routes
- Hashing passwords with bcrypt
- Generating JWT tokens
- Writing authentication middleware
- Protecting routes by role (buyer/seller)

Please continue from this exact point and help me build Phase 2 of the backend.
 ✅ Phase 2 Complete!
Now you have:

A working user model

Password security with bcrypt

JWT-based auth system

Register and login APIs

Middleware to protect future routes

## pahse 3  

🔜 Phase 3: User Role Access & Dashboard APIs
In the next phase, we will:

Create protected routes for buyers and sellers

Start building request/deal APIs

Tie them to the user (with role-based control) 







Hi ChatGPT, I'm continuing work on **Requestly**, a real-time local marketplace web app.

### ✅ Project Context:

#### 🚀 FRONTEND (React):
- Built using React (no routing, view controlled via global `AppContext` + local `useState`).
- Key components:
  - `LandingPage`: Visible when user not logged in
  - `AuthModal`: Handles login/register and updates global user context
  - `BuyerDashboard` / `SellerDashboard`: Loaded post-auth based on user role
  - Other features: `ChatSystem`, `Notifications`, and `Profile` — toggled locally via state in `App.tsx`
- Currently using **mock data** (`mockData.ts`)
- API layer will use **Axios** once connected to backend

---

#### 🛠️ BACKEND (Node.js, Express, MongoDB):
- Stack:
  - Node.js, Express, MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose
  - JWT + bcrypt for auth
  - Socket.IO for real-time chat (planned in future phase)
- Project Setup Completed (Phase 1):
  - Installed all dependencies: `express`, `mongoose`, `cors`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, `socket.io`
  - Connected to MongoDB
  - `.env` with `MONGO_URI`, `PORT`, `JWT_SECRET`

---

### ✅ Backend Progress:

#### ✅ **Phase 2: Auth System** (DONE)
- Created `User` model (`name`, `email`, `password`, `role`)
- `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login` endpoints
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- JWT generation on login
- Middleware for auth (`authMiddleware.js`)
- Role-based access control added (`roleMiddleware.js`)

---

#### ✅ **Phase 3: Role-Based APIs & Dashboards** (DONE)
- Created `Request` model (title, description, budget, createdBy)
- Created `Deal` model (requestId, sellerId, offerPrice, status)
- Buyer-only endpoints:
  - `POST /api/requests` → create request
  - `GET /api/requests/mine` → get own requests
- Seller-only endpoints:
  - `POST /api/deals/:requestId` → send offer
  - `GET /api/deals/mine` → get own deals
- Protected via JWT and role middleware
- Data tied to user accounts

---

### ⏭️ NEXT: **Phase 4 – Real-Time Chat System (Socket.IO)**

We'll build:
- Chat model (buyer-seller messaging)
- WebSocket connection for real-time communication
- API to fetch past conversations
- Chat UI integration with frontend `ChatSystem` component

🔜 Phase 4 Preview: Chat System Integration (Socket.IO)
Next up, you can:

Enable buyer ↔ seller chat on a request/deal

Store messages in MongoDB

Use Socket.IO to emit real-time messages








# remove it 
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://user:Attock512@cluster0.ku8654t.mongodb.net/
JWT_SECRET=Attock
