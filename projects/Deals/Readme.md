🧠 Project Title: Requestly — Real-Time Local Requests Marketplace
🔧 Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
🎯 Project Overview
Build a full-stack MERN web application called Requestly, enabling users to post and receive real-time requests for local services, products, rentals, or food. Requests are categorized and geo-tagged, allowing nearby vendors or individuals to respond with offers.
