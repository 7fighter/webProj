## Q purpose of double dot ..
here it is shown
```js
//src/app.jsx
import Home from '../Pages/Home' 
```
is sy murad jis folder main abi hoo is sy bahir aoo or /pages means pages ka andr jao udr andr /home ka andr jaoo




## short cut and Frontend 
1. `rafce` gives the bioler code for app. 
2. import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom' //this lines some time might be written by yourself not get suggested insde the app.jsx
3. `useStateSnippest` ki madad sy hum ract ka variable bany gy or isa `two way binding` v kahty hain
    it has two things 
      1. name 
      2. setname 
  - onchange function: oftentyly used to setName in the name when dealing with inout fields 
   - preventDefault: used with froms without this form on submit refrech the page
